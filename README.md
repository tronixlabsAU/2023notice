Hello!

Our clearance store is taking a break while we change to a new store cart system as bigcommerce are completely useless. 

If you are an existing Tronixlabs customer and require technical or warranty support - I'm still here to help you, simply email support@tronixlabs.com.

If you are in Australia and would like to buy a copy or two of one of my books - which is a great idea - please email support@tronixlabs.com
and we'll sort it out very quickly.

Follow us on facebook, x/twitter, and/or instagram using:

https://www.facebook.com/tronixlabs

https://twitter.com/tronixlabs

https://www.instagram.com/tronixlabs

... and you'll find out when we're back. 

Or keep an eye out for our notice in an upcoming issue of Silicon Chip and DIYODE magazines. 

Otherwise, have fun and make something!

sincerely,

John Boxall
