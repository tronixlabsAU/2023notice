Hello!

Our retail store is taking a break for a while. 
If you are an existing Tronixlabs customer and require technical or warranty support - we're still here to help you, simply email support@tronixlabs.com.

Our larger international electronics store, however, is open and growing like mad. Check it out now >> https://pmdway.com. Send us an email saying you found it from github and I'll send you a discount coupon.
As of 9th April, 2025 - due to the mad tariff situation, we no longer ship to the United States. 


If you are in Australia and would like to buy a copy or two of one of my books (https://nostarch.com/search/boxall) - which is a great idea - please email support@tronixlabs.com
and we'll sort it out very quickly. 

Follow us on social media using:

... and you'll find out what we're up to, and when the Australian retail store is back. 

Or keep an eye out for our notice in an upcoming issue of [Silicon Chip magazine](https://www.siliconchip.com.au/). 

Otherwise, have fun and make something!

sincerely,

John Boxall VK4JBX
