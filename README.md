Hello!

Our retail store is taking a break for a while.
If you are an existing Tronixlabs customer and require technical or warranty support - we're still here to help you, simply email support@tronixlabs.com.

Our larger international electronics store, however, is open and growing like mad. Check it out! https://pmdway.com Send us an email saying you found it from github and I'll send you a discount coupon!

If you are in Australia and would like to buy a copy or two of one of my books (https://nostarch.com/search/boxall) - which is a great idea - please email support@tronixlabs.com
and we'll sort it out very quickly.

Follow us on facebook, x/twitter, and/or instagram using:

https://www.facebook.com/tronixlabs

https://twitter.com/tronixlabs

https://www.instagram.com/tronixlabs

... and you'll find out when we're back. 

Or keep an eye out for our notice in an upcoming issue of Silicon Chip magazine. 

Otherwise, have fun and make something!

sincerely,

John Boxall
